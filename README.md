# *Perpetual* by Takens Theorem

"Creator and collectors are now interwoven into a [little machine](https://perpetual.takens.eth.limo). And unlike its patrons, that little machine lives forever."

**This repository is an evanescent resource** 

In this repository, I offer occasional reflections on *Perpetual*'s releases, community activities and so on. This information is on this centralized service and may not live forever. So the collector is encouraged to visit the main site [here](https://perpetual.takens.eth.limo), the coordinator contract or the most recent ERC-721 contract. These are listed below. Each subfolder of this repository contains notes about releases on *Perpetual*.

* Visit the main [*Perpetual* site](https://perpetual.takens.eth.limo)
* [Coordinator contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf67d4aea92423f999cb3c1b4be979cc03968eda6#code)
