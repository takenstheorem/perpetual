### More

* Emergent, composed complexity and divergence of human minds. Words proliferate. Departures from optimal composition everywhere. A local cultural evolution. Targeted, selected growth.

* Those who participated were goal-directed and playful and profane, seeking value and attention. Much like biological systems diverge from a statistically neutral process, we see memetic divergences. From letters and with dashes into phrases and more. 

* For collectors, some samples assembled with simple generator functions from common letters to composite ideas. The new contract itself, in aggregate, is a generator function bringing practical infinity out of a limited set of these raw materials.
