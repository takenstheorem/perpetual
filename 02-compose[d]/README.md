### Dispatch from the chain #1

Emergent composed complexity showing divergences of human minds. Recovered contract contents from state and inspected their composition. Was not perfectly regular nor random. Departures from optimal composition everywhere. Seems evolutionary in a cultural way because those who participated were goal-directed and playful and profane in parts seeking value and attention. The ideas encoded in the state are reflections of their emergent local cultural activities. Much like biological systems diverge from a statistically neutral process memetic divergences show a kind of targeted growth. From letters and with dashes into phrases and more. graph shown with this message to illustrate these trends. For The Collectors samples assembled with simple generator functions from common letters to composite ideas. Generator functions skip according to the themes noticed. This new contract itself is a generator function bringing near infinity out of a limited set of these raw materials. Awaiting a major drop in cost of assembly and will transport to chain.
