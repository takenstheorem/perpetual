# Proposal 1

**Proposal summary**: Implement "hard fork" on the renderer to ensure all DAO proposals are included in the collection along with some improvements in issuance and presentation.

âœ… **Yea vote** supports implementing the following changes: (i) increase jump across windows to ensure spanning all DAO proposals and (ii) minor visual modifications (see detail below). ðŸš§ This outcome will change the appearance of all tokens ðŸš§.

ðŸš« **Nay vote** is a vote to leave the collection as-is, with sequential composition of the archives and incomplete span of the DAO's proposals. This outcome will leave tokens unchanged.

### Voting Procedures

**Quorum**: 25% snapshot wallets responding. Simple majority vote determines outcome.

**Voting rights** derive from transacting with *Perpetual*, and snapshot will be added to [snapshot.org](https://snapshot.org/#/) (for security: using the hot wallets that summoned *Perpetual* for minting). Voting power will derive from number of interactions with *Perpetual / Vol . 1* [ERC-721 contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbbcfcc50a2885495ab789e06bab7d8f85d2f73ce). NB: Snapshot ends at token #146.

**Snapshot link**: Posted here when vote opens.

**Voting open / deadline**: opens Jan. 21st, 2023 and closes Jan. 28th, 2023.

### Full Description

The archives do not yet span the full space of the first experiment machine ([The DAO](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413#readContract)). When the next render is released on *Perpetual*, there may be many abandoned DAO proposals not represented in the collection. Moreover, the sequential issuance of the tokens produces redundancies. This was initially by design, because it produces natural scarcity properties, but it may improve the collection to have windows jump across DAO proposals so that the minted "Archives" span the full set of DAO proposals. Rather than a smooth sliding window ([see here](https://twitter.com/takenstheorem/status/1747990153354723396)), token renderings will skip more proposals, thus spanning the DAO's proposal set. Also included in this proposal: Use DAO proposal start and end index instead of token ID number in the name of each piece (e.g., "Archive 40/3" instead of "[Archive #3](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xbbcfcc50a2885495ab789e06bab7d8f85d2f73ce/3)"). Reasoning: Token ID may not be meaningful in future *Perpetual* minting when the dead man's switch triggers. **A "yea" outcome does not cost any gas fees to implement; Takens will release the new renderer and tokens will update automatically.**

**Note**: This proposal and vote are for amusement, a little simulation of the collective activity of the release's subject itself. Mutual interests converging, determining a project's future. I may use more proposals in the future for fun, but this is only a one-time experience for now, simulating another aspect of the first experiment machine.
